Turn in your project specification, and any related documents, to
this directory.

Please remember to include the original proposal in your specification
document(s), and explicitly highlight any differences between your
current plans and the original proposal.  (By "original proposal" we
mean the original proposal for the project you are implementing.  If
you are implementing a project proposed by another team, the "original
proposal" is their original proposal, not yours.)
