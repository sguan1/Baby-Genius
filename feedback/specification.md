Project Specification Feedback

### The product backlog (9/10)

A spreadsheet-like format is easier to read for backlogs, rather than prose or bulleted lists.  You could also consider exploring existing online tools for generating and tracking work on a project.

You should have a clear assignment of responsibility for each feature, to the student or students on the team who will complete that feature.  Each student should have sole responsibility for some features on the overall project.

You should have a cost estimate for each feature, in hours.  If the cost estimate is more than 5 or 8 hours, you should consider breaking the feature into smaller work units to improve your ability to track progress on it.

I don't understand how books fit into your project. Who will be adding the books? Are they existing books? Will you be using a related API for this features? 

Also, how will videos be added? 

How will you implement tests/exams?

### Data models (9/10)

You misnamed your videos Model.

You also mentioned that for each user you will be storing the top 3 most recent scores for each game. This should be somehow incorporated into your user model or game models. For each game, instead of using the user id, you should utilize model relationship fields. 

### Wireframes or mock-ups (9/10)

Your wireframes do not show how users start a game or how they choose a game.
